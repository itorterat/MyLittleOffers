# README

Need to complete this Readme to explain how to install my project.
But basically, you need to : 
- install Ruby
- install Ruby On Rails
- clone my repository
- run "bundle install" to install all the depedencies
- go into the repo, and run "rails server" or "rails s" to start the server
- navigate to "http://localhost:3000" and have fun !
