# README

Need to complete this Readme to explain how to install my project.
But basically, you need to:
(- have a look there, to install Ruby and Ruby On Rails : https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html#installing-rails)
- install Ruby
- install Ruby On Rails
- clone my repository
- go into the repo, and run "bundle install" to install all the dependencies
- in the repo, run "rails server" or "rails s" to start the server
- navigate to "http://localhost:3000" and have fun !
